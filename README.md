# Iris_Classification
 "Iris Classification using ML" involves building a machine learning model to classify different species of iris flowers based on their characteristics. The famous Iris dataset is often used for this type of project, and it contains measurements of various features of three iris species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

Here's a general outline of the steps involved in my project:

Data Collection: Obtain the Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for a number of iris flowers. This dataset is commonly available in libraries like scikit-learn or can be found from various online sources.

Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data and checking for any missing values or outliers that may affect the model's performance. Additionally, you'll need to convert categorical labels (species names) into numerical values, so the model can process them.

Data Exploration and Visualization: It's essential to explore the dataset to understand the distribution of each feature and look for any correlations between them. Data visualization techniques, such as scatter plots or pair plots, can help in this analysis.

Feature Selection: Based on the insights gained from data exploration, you may choose to select specific features that contribute the most to the classification task. This step is not always necessary, as the Iris dataset is relatively small and contains only relevant features.

Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

Model Selection: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for your classification task. Common choices for this type of problem include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), or logistic regression.

Model Training: Train the selected model using the training data. The model will learn to classify the iris flowers based on the provided features.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using the testing data. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
